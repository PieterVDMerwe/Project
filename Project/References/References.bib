  abstract={In this paper, we have considered a model of modified Chaplygin gas and its role in the accelerating phase of the universe. We have assumed that the equation of state of this modified model is valid from the radiation era to the ΛCDM model. We have used recently developed statefinder parameters in characterizing different phases of the universe diagrammatically.}

  abstract={Realizing Refsdal’s original idea from 1964, we present estimates of the Hubble constant that are complementary to, and potentially competitive with, those of other cosmological probes. We use the observed positions of 89 multiple images, with extensive spectroscopic information, from 28 background sources and the measured time delays between the images S1–S4 and SX of supernova “Refsdal” ( z = 1.489), which were obtained thanks to Hubble Space Telescope deep imaging and Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer data. We extend the strong-lensing modeling of the Hubble Frontier Fields galaxy cluster MACS J1149.5+2223 ( z = 0.542), published by Grillo et al. (2016), and explore different ΛCDM models. Taking advantage of the lensing information associated to the presence of very close pairs of multiple images at various redshifts, and to the extended surface brightness distribution of the SN Refsdal host, we can reconstruct the total mass-density profile of the cluster very precisely. The combined dependence of the multiple-image positions and time delays on the cosmological parameters allows us to infer the values of H 0 and Ω m with relative (1 σ ) statistical errors of, respectively, 6% (7%) and 31% (26%) in flat (general) cosmological models, assuming a conservative 3% uncertainty on the final time delay of image SX and, remarkably, no priors from other cosmological experiments. Our best estimate of H 0 , based on the model described in this work, will be presented when the final time-delay measurement becomes available. Our results show that it is possible to utilize time delays in lens galaxy clusters as an important alternative tool for measuring the expansion rate and the geometry of the universe.}

  abstract = {For the last 100 years, General Relativity (GR) has taken over the gravitational theory mantle held by Newtonian Gravity for the previous 200 years. This article reviews the status of GR in terms of its self-consistency, completeness, and the evidence provided by observations, which have allowed GR to remain the champion of gravitational theories against several other classes of competing theories. We pay particular attention to the role of GR and gravity in cosmology, one of the areas in which one gravity dominates and new phenomena and effects challenge the orthodoxy. We also review other areas where there are likely conflicts pointing to the need to replace or revise GR to represent correctly observations and consistent theoretical framework. Observations have long been key both to the theoretical liveliness and viability of GR. We conclude with a  discussion of the likely developments over the next 100 years.},
